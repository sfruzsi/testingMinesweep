## Mine Sweeper - Game Rules:

You are presented with a board of squares. Some squares contain mines (bombs), others don't. If you step
on a square containing a bomb, you lose. If you manage to clear all the squares (without clicking on any
bombs) you win.
Clearing a square which doesn't have a bomb reveals the number of neighbouring squares containing bombs.
If you guess a square contains a bomb mark it with a flag.
A squares "neighbours" are the squares adjacent above, below, left, right, and all 4 diagonals. Squares on the
sides of the board or in a corner have fewer neighbors. The board does not wrap around the edges. If you
clear a square with 0 neighboring bombs, all its neighbors will automatically open; recursively.
The first square you open could be a bomb.
You don't have to mark all the bombs to win; you just need to open all non-bomb squares.

## User story 1

> As a player I want a board and 0 < x < 9 mines So that I can play the game

- Scenario 1: Given the board is 3x3 When I start the game Then I see a 3x3 board
- Scenario 2: Given the board is 3x3 When I start the game Then I have more than 1 mine but less than 9 and the numbers in the surrounding cells

## User story 2

> As a player I want the game to end when I click on a bomb So that I can play properly

- Given the board has mines When I click on the mine Then the game ends
